# Drag-and-Drop Mode Toggle
<h2>ðŸ§© Built by Mohammed Faizan</h2>
This is a feature that allows users to toggle between Drag-and-Drop Mode and Default Mode in an interactive application. It enables the user to drag items around the screen when in Drag-and-Drop Mode, and revert back to a static, non-draggable state when switched to Default Mode.

<h1>ðŸ“‹ Features</h1>
Drag-and-Drop Mode: Allows users to drag items around the screen.
Default Mode: When toggled, prevents elements from being dragged, making them static.
Toggle Button: Easily switch between modes with a single button.
Visual Feedback: Visual cues (such as cursor change) indicate when an item is draggable.<br><br>
